# Evaluate News using NLP 


## overview 

This project requires you to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites.


## steps 

This project is for implementing those concepts:
### 1- setting up a node server 

### 2- use express framework for routing 

### 3- use webpack tool to have the ability to control what happens when in your website 

### 4- use external script fro service worker to have offline support if without full functionality

### 5- use api from other website to sentiment analysis  

### 6- use jest and know how to test your functions 


## what i have faced 

dependencies conflicts !!!
the solution is to search for the latest versions for used npm libraries expect webpack-cli use version 3 as version 4 not working with web server dev
